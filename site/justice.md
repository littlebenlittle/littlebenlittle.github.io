    A commitment to justice is more than words. It is
    an ongoing process of self-reflection, research,
    and action. This statement is intended to be part
    of my own process of self-reflection.

## Power and Privilege

My relationship to power and privilege is
complex. As the child of two college-educated parents, I was
given access to knowledge that most people alive today were
not afforded. As someone who is partially paralyzed, I
live each day in a world that repeatedly traumzatizes my body
in ways that most people do not experience. I hold both of
these truths at once at commit to using the power I have to
tell my story and create space for the stories of others.

## Heritage

The knowledge and skills I posess are not mine alone. These
are gifts bestowed by previous generations with hope for a
future free from the bondage of unnecessary suffering. These
are tools to be used responsibly for the benefit of those
who will come after me. I commit to understand the nature
of my own skills and knowledge and putting them to use in service
of all. I commit to teaching when asked and learning from
all.

## Truth

Truth is not fixed. It differs from time to time, place to
place, and person to person. Truth is personal. It is okay
for two people to hold conflicting truths. It is okay for
one person to hold conflicting truths. The process of
building harmony is the process of allowing conflicting
truths to coexist. I commit to living my truth, telling
my truth, and holding space for others' truth.
