  excerpt: >-
    I enjoy designing computer systems to meet human needs and am highly
    motivated by projects with social impact. My computing journey started 8 years
    ago when I first saw the potential of computer networks as tools for organizing
    and empowerment, if only we could move beyond centralized platforms like social
    media and search engines.

I'm a software engineer who's obsessed with building simple,
correct, and understandable applications. My number one goal
is to help people not only use but also understand computers.

For me, simplicity, correctness, and understandability are
ethical imperatives. As a computer expert designing software
for non-technical users, I acknowledge the power imbalance
that is inherent to that relationship and accept responsiblity
for the impact that my applications have on users.
