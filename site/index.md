{{{ meta.description }}}

For me, simplicity, correctness, and understandability are
ethical imperatives. As a computer expert designing software
for non-technical users, I acknowledge the power imbalance
that is inherent to that relationship and accept responsiblity
for the impact that my applications have on users.
