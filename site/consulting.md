Building something new is exciting and challenging. Let me help!

## Alchemy

As alchemy is absolutely central to all domains in which I have expertise, I
wanted to introduce it now:

During the renaissance and enlightenment in Europe, every scientist was an
alchemist: Newton, Descartes, and Leibniz, to name a few. Alchemy served as a
framework for understanding our spiritual place in the universe through the
process of scientific discovery.

While history has often reduced this sacred practice to some mumbo-jumbo about
turning lead into gold, the reality is that alchemy is just as vital to science
today as it was centuries ago. Through observation and experimentation, the
alchemist ultimately discovers truths about their own self. The alchemist
understands the fundamental inter- connectedness of knowledge and spirituality
in a way that modern academics unfortunately snub their noses at.

Rather than chasing publication after publication in order to secure funding for
another year, alchemists pursue science as a means of self-actualization and
spirtitual fulfilment. Our world needs more scientists driven by purpose and
curiosity, as the last hundred years have uncovered the myriad dangers that
careless technological advancement can create.

## Mathematics

People usually think that mathematics is about numbers. But the true beauty of
mathematics is in the study of logic. Mathematicians study the relationships
between facts and try to determine when two different sets of facts are actually
equivalent. This skill has been beneficial to all areas of science, from
sociology to chemistry to computer science.

## Physics

## Software Engineering
