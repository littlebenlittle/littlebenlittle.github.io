**Building something new?**

As a consultant, my goal is to help you identify the needs of your project and
design a low-complexity solution that meets those needs. I want to you to feel
confident that you understand what we are building together and that you know
how to maintain it for years to come.

For members of my local community, I provide consulting services at
low-to-no-cost. For businesses and commercial ventures I charge a reasonable
fee. Please [get in contact](/) for more information.

## Alchemy

Alchemy is the process of turning one thing into another. It is the
often-neglected undercurrent of all science, as it deals with the somatic
experience _doing_ science.

Important **Alchemical** Questions:

-   Why are things not okay as they are?
-   What would help things to be better?
-   What might it look like to go from where we are to where we want to be?

## Mathematics

To put it as elegantly as I know how, mathematics is conversion of thought into
symbol. It is the translation of the world that we _feel_ into a world that we
can _describe_. Mathematics is deeply tied to measurement and the logical
relations between those measurements.

Important **Mathematical** Questions:

-   What should we measure to define success and failure?
-   How do those measurements relate to one another?
-   What are we leaving out of our measurements?

## Software Engineering

After developing our _alchemical goals_ and _mathematical theories_, it's time
to actually build something. This is usually the most tedious process and
involves reading a lot of documentation and source code.

Important **Engineering** Questions:

-   What tools are already available?
-   Which symbols and representations do those tools use?
-   How can we translate between different symbols and representations?
