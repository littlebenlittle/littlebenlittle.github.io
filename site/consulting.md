Building something new? Diving into a complex research topic? Let me help!

## Alchemy

As alchemy is absolutely central to all domains in which I have expertise, I
wanted to introduce it now:

During the renaissance and enlightenment in Europe, every scientist was an
alchemist: Da Vinci, Botticelli, the Bernoullis, Newton, Descartes, and Leibniz,
to name a few. Alchemy served as a framework for understanding our spiritual
place in the universe through the process of scientific discovery.

While history has often reduced this sacred practice to some greedy mumbo-jumbo
about turning lead into gold, the reality is that alchemy is just as vital to
science today as it was centuries ago. Through observation and experimentation,
the alchemist ultimately discovers truths about their own self. The alchemist
understands the fundamental inter-connectedness of knowledge and spirituality in
a way that modern academics unfortunately disregard, or worse snub their noses
at.

Rather than chasing publication after publication in order to secure funding for
another year, alchemists pursue science as a means of self-actualization and
spirtitual fulfilment. Science must be driven by purpose and curiosity, as the
last hundred years have uncovered the myriad dangers that careless technological
advancement can create.

During any consultation, some questions that you should expect from an
alchemical perspective are:

-   Why are things not okay as they are now?
-   What would help things to become better?
-   How would you do it if you no had tools or resources to rely on?
-   What does success feel like? What does failure feel like?
-   What are our shared values as we embark on this journey?

## Mathematics

To put it as elegantly as I know how, mathematics is conversion of thought into
symbol. It is the translation of the world that we _feel_ into a world that we
can _describe_. The challenge of mathematics is not that we do not know how our
world works, but rather that we lack practice is explaining it precisely.

After getting a grasp of the _alchemical_ properties of a problem, we will begin
the _mathematical_ process of identifying the ways in which the world that we
feel can be expressed as data that can be written on paper. This process is also
called model design and is an opportunity to reflect on which parts of the
problem matter to our chosen value system.

## Physics

Physics is a genuinely magical art form. The fact that we can manipulate our
universe in ways that are reproducible and reliable is astonishing. The fact
that these processes are often described by elegant mathematical theories is
even more astonishing.

After we have developed a mathematical theory for the problem, we will begin the
process of realizing a physical model. This includes the selection of
appropriate hardware, assembly of that hardware if necessary, and testing for
conformance to our theory's assumptions.

## Software Engineering

Given the abundance of existing tools in the forms of mathematical theories and
physical hardware, many problems simply reduce to finding the correct way to
make all the parts work together. While I prefer the term "hacking" as it
alludes to a laborious process of chopping away at things until they fit, that
word often comes with some negative connotations from popular media. So instead
I use the term "software engineering" to refer to the process of getting all the
tools to work together.

Of all the topics listed above, software engineering is definitely the least
elegant and requires the most tedious work. Often this looks like reading
documentation and source code while playing with the system until things start
working. Throughout the process I will keep you updated with research findings
and demos when possible. I am also happy to explain anything you want to
understand better, although I will warn you that the answers are
often--well--inelegant.
