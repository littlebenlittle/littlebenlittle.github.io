# {{{ title }}}

My name is Ben (he/they) and I am a computer scientist, mathematician, and software engineer. I enjoy designing computer systems to meet human needs and am highly motivated by projects with social impact. My computing journey started 8 years ago when I first saw the potential of computer networks as tools for organizing and empowerment, if only we could move beyond centralized platforms like social media and search engines.

My ideal job is designing and prototyping tools that empower more people to build tools that meet their needs. Some examples are compilers, virtual machines, and programming languages. This is a highly specialized area and I suspect that only a few organizations are looking for someone with these skills.

I am very experienced with writing code in a variety of languages including rust, go, python, shell, typescript, and many more. I know how to write documentation and tests to keep code maintainable and build CI/CD pipelines with GitHub actions and Gitlab CI. This is probably the most realistic application of my skills as many organizations need more code authors and maintainers.

I also have a lot of experience configuring operating systems and web services. I have worked extensively with linux, including running VMs, designing and configuring networks, and managing services with systemd. I have also built containerized applications and deployed them with docker, podman, and kubernetes. While most of my experience is on self-managed hardware, I have found that these skills transfer well into using the various cloud platforms that exist today.

More generally, I am pretty good at just figuring out how to do things with a computer. I have built a few websites with WordPress, written automation scripts for Google Drive, and made some contributions to open source projects on GitHub. I am good at figuring out what isnâ€™t working and doing research to find a solution.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and if you could use the help of someone with these skills, please send me an email at [ben.little@benlittle.dev](mailto:ben.little@benlittle.dev).
