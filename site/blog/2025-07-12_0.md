# Hello World

## The Blog

_I'm starting off my tech blog again._

Previously I treated my blog as an incubator for ideas that I hoped would become
research publications. As I am shifting my focus away from mainstream academia
and more toward community-based knowledge sharing, I intend to use my blog more
as a repository for little tricks and hacks I find while building out real
computer systems.

I hope this blog will serve the growth of community knowledge about how to
design, build, and use computer systems effectively by leveraging open source
tools. I may still post some theoretical stuff now and then if I get the itch to
do so.

## Services

Over the past few years I have grown quite suspicious of traditional
exchange-based means of building social structures. In the spirit of mutual aid
and post-scarcity thinking, I am offering tech services for little-to-no-cost to
members of my local community. If you are in the Boulder area, please
[reach out](/).
