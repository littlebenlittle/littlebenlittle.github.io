# Hello World

I'm starting off my tech blog again.

## Ending a Toxic Relationship with Academia

My experiences over the past few years have shifted my focus away from
institutionalized academia and more towards community based education and
knowledge-sharing. The intersection of an ever-increasing cost of living,
transportation challenges, failings in the medical system, and ubiquitous
miseducation about disability within academia itself has led me to realize that
continuing with any sort of formal education is a dead-end path for me.

## Shifting Focus Toward Community

Now more than ever, there is a need for a style of education that puts the
community first. Knowledge and resource sharing in the form of mutual aid has
become a part of public awareness, and I believe this model is better-suited to
the needs of the time in which I live. As such I am offering the knowledge and
skills I have at little-to-no-cost to members of my local community.

Please message me if you are the Boulder/NoCo area and are in need of assistance
with any of the skills I am offering.

_Please note that I do charge for business-related and commercial work. Contact
me for price inquiries._
