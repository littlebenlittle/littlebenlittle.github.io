excerpt: >-
  Our senses are the beginning of how we form
  ideas about reality and ultimately how we
  interpret our experience of it. In this post,
  I talk about some of my philosophy on data
  and what we can do to take better care of our
  wellbeing through conscious effort to understand
  the relationship between the data we use and
  how it affects our perception.

## Data is What Makes Us Who We Are

### Data is Context

Like every living creature, humans need to make sense of the world
around us. We do this first and foremost in our bodies; through
touch, sight, sound, smell, our thoughts, and so on. We also build
a sense of our world through communication. This vital flow of
_data_ is how we build a model of the world in these strange fleshy
computers we call bodies.

From a computer and information science persepective, data _is_
programming. We react to our environment in response to the data we
receive from it. This isn't new insight. It's something humanity
has known for millennia at least. In Buddhist tradition, there is a
teaching:

* _Guard your senses, for they will become your thoughts._
* _Guard your thoughts, for they will become your words._
* _Guard your words, for they will become your actions._
* _Guard your actions, for they will become what you are._

We become what what we perceive, and it takes wisdom to recognize
this process and intervene when our values and our perception are
in a state of incoherence.

### Sharing Data in the Modern World

In the very recent history of the universe, the flow of data has
become global. Not so long ago, news from the next town over
wouldn't reach us for days or even weeks, while today we have
access to video streams from across the globe, delivered in seconds.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has led many to take a more global 
perspective. At the same time, it has also made it easier for
centralized media services with opaque motives to poke and prod 
their audiences into assuming different thoughts, words, actions, 
and ultimately states of being.

So we have a dilemma. Modern technology has the potential to create
a global network of sensory information, allowing humans to solve
problems and react to novel threats in a manner never before seen.
At the same time it also has the potential to become a tool of
mass surveillance and behavioral programming that robs us of our
agency and leaves us impotent in the face of those very same 
threats. What are we to make of this? How should humans thinkabout 
data, information, and the technology used to move, modify, and 
present it?

## The Process of Knowing

One area in which modern information technology is sorely lacking
is the _accountability_ of data. The process of how data is 
originated and how it got to our little devices is almost always
entirely hidden. The data we have access to is just whatever
pops up in our news feeds and search engines, without even the
_option_ of investigating why that particular website or news
article was chosen among thousands or even millions of alternatives.

One way to begin cracking open this problem is to start rethinking
our relationship to data. I've organized some suggestions below,
and in a later post I'll give some examples of what these steps mean for technology.

### Step 1: Keep Track of the Data You Use

Starting to monitor which data we are being exposed to is the start 
of taking responsibility for how we react to that data. If instead
we just allow data to enter our awareness and then forget about
its details, it becomes impossible to discern _why_ we think what
we do. Do I believe this because I read it somewhere? Did I hear
about in a video? A news article? When did I learn this? On whose
authority am I relying? None of these questions can be answered
if we don't have access to at least _some_ information about the
data that has passed into our awareness.

### Step 2: Keep Track of the Context in Which You Use Data

Once we are aware of the data we are using, we can start to
monitor the context in which we used that data. Did you read
a news article on bus or on the couch? Did you get a notification
or did you choose to open the data on your own time? How were
you feeling before you interacted with the data? Ater?

### Step 3: Understand How the Data You Use Affects You

Once we are keeping track of the data we use, we can start
to see patterns in how our beliefs and actions are influenced
by that data. Some data may seem to have little affect on us,
while other data may significantly alter our beliefs or state
of mind. Noticing and possibly keeping a record of these effects
can help use better understand the nuanced relationship we have
with data and help us consciously discern data that is helpful
from data that is not.

### Step 4: Understand the Sources of the Data You Use

Data comes from a variety of places. Asking questions about
the when, where, and who of our data can help us build a better
understanding of our own mind and behavior. Some of the major
questions we ask ourselves should be:

* Where does my data come from?
* Is anyone over-represented or under-represented in those
  sources?
* Are there any patterns, like a strong correlation between
  data from different sources?

### Step 5: Consider the Limitations of Data

Data is always a lossy representation of reality. Even our
body can't keep track of every little input it receives from
our phyiscal sense. We can't expect much more from our little
computers with their puny terabytes of data. Choosing how to
represent and use data is philisophical and moral pursuit.
Don't take it lightly!

## Conclusions

There really are an unimaginable number of questions we could
ask about relationships between data, data sources, and our
understanding of the world around us. Building a peaceful and
respectful worldview takes work, and unfortunately most of the
information tools avaiable to us today don't make that work
convenient or intuitive. Stay tuned for some ideas on how
technology could improve in this area.
