# Configuring Autologin on TTY

Generally automatic login is security risk. But there are some situations where
it makes sense, such as when running a VM or LXC container on a single-user host
machine. In this case the user is already authenticated by nature of having
access to VM or container's TTY and the need to type in a password is really
just a hindrance.

## Alpine

Alpine still uses the inittab configuration file. Install [`agetty(8)`][agetty]
and then update inittab.

`/etc/inittab`:

```
tty1::respawn:/sbin/agetty --autologin root tty1 linux
```

## Fedora

On Fedora, autologin still prompts for a password. To get a true automatic
login, PAM must be configured to treat all login attempts from the given TTY
device as authenticated. See [`pam.d(5)`][pam.d] and
[`pam_listfile(8)`][pam_listfile] for more information.

`/etc/pam.d/login`:

```
auth sufficient pam_listfile.so item=tty sense=allow file=/etc/securetty onerr=fail apply=root
```

Populate the file listed above with the desired TTY device. You can find this by
logging in to the TTY and running the [`tty(1)`][tty] command.

`/etc/securetty`:

```
/dev/tty1
```

Finally configure the [`agetty(8)`][agetty] systemd unit with the `--autologin`
flag using a drop-in configuration file:

`/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf`:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root -o '-p -- \\u' --noclear - $TERM
```
