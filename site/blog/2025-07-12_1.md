# VMs vs LXC vs Docker

> **_When should I use a VM vs LXC vs Docker?_**

Virtual machines (VMs), [Linux containers][lxc] (LXC), and [OCI containers][oci]
(Docker) are all virtualization technologies that allow us to separate programs
from the host system. This provides added security and a certain degree of
"oops" protection when running untrusted or experimental code.

For some time, I've struggled to figure out how I should decide which tool is
appropriate for which situation. Just the other day I had an epiphany and
realized this simple decision process:

The **TL;DR** is:

1. If I need to run a separate CPU architecture or separate OS kernel, I use a
   **VM**.
2. If I don't care about running a separate kernel but still need a full init
   system, I use **LXC**.
3. If I just want to run an isolated application, I use **OCI** containers.

## Overview of Each Tool

### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine is a full system also called a "guest", that usually includes
a bootloader, kernel, initramfs, and root filesystem. They run on virtualization
environments (VEs) like [qemu][qemu], [xen][xen], and [virtualbox][virtualbox].
The VE or host provides the guest kernel with virtual hardware, i.e. code that
acts like hardware and provides a host-controlled bridge between the real
hardware and guest. This makes the guest VMs highly isolated from the host, and
the guest can even run kernels that are compiled for different architectures
than the host--for example a RISCV guest running on an x86_64 host.

[xen]: https://xenproject.org/
[virtualbox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/

**PROS**

VMs are the most flexible option, as the host VE has complete programmatic
control over the virtual hardware the guest has access to. VMs can also be
easily "broken out" into a bare-metal machine by writing their backing storage
to a physical storage device and putting it in a separate machine.

**CONS**

VMs require an entirely separate kernel and thus take up a lot of memory.
Because their hardware is fully virtualized, there is also additional
computational overhead needed to manage access to the virtual hardware.

### LXC

LXC is the name given to a bundle of userspace tools that leverage Linux kernel
containment features like [`chroot(1)`][chroot] and [`cgroups(7)`][cgroups] to
create environments that are separate from the host but without requiring full
hardware virtualization like VMs. If VMs virtualize hardware resources, LXC
containers virtualize kernel resources.

LXC containers are primarily intended to run a full OS (minus the kernel), so
they usually include an init system like [`systemd(1)`][systemd] or
[`openrc`][openrc]. This makes them an excellent drop-in replacement for VMs
when kernel separation is not a requirement.

**PROS**

Full OS virtualization without needing to run a separate kernel.

**CONS**

Less flexibility than VMs due to reliance on the same kernel, slower startup
than OCI containers due to init system.

### OCI Containers (Docker)

OCI containers--formerly known as [Docker][docker] containers--rely on the same
Linux kernel containment features as LXC, but were built with a different
use-case in mind: [microservices][microservices].

Each OCI container usually only runs a single process and therefore does not
need any sort of init system. Additionally each container is meant to be run
from a stateless base filesystem for increased reproducibility, so if a
contanerized application malfunctions then restarting the container will run it
from a fresh state.

**PROS**

Fast startup and reproducibility.

**CONS**

Only intended to run a single microservice-oriented application.

## Summary

Any of the tools mentioned above can be used to run any application. The
question about which tool to use comes down to resource consumption and
efficiency.

VMs are resource-intensive but provide the greatest flexibility.

LXC containers are less resource-intensive but are still meant to run full
systems.

OCI containers are the least resource-intensive but require the adoption of a
microservice-oriented application deployment strategy.
