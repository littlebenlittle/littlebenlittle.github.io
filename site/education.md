# Education

---

A resilient community is one that has the knowledge and skills to care for
itself. For that purpose, I offer little-to-no-cost personalized education to
members of my local community. I also offer the same to busisnesses and
commercial ventures for a reasonable fee. Please [get in contact](/) for more
information.

## Linux

[Linux][linux] is the most used software in the world, sitting at the core of
everything from high performance computing clusters to mobile phones. Its
ubiquity is largely due to its open source software license that allows anyone
to modify and redistribute the software freely, meaning that experts and
hobbyists the world over have been able to tune the software to work in
multitudes of different environments for various purposes.

I have used Linux-based computer systems for almost a decade and am delighted to
introduce people to this powerful tool. I can teach beginners to download, test,
and install a Linux-based operating system on your personal computer. For those
who want to go deeper, I can teach you about how operating systems works and how
to build your own Linux-based software distribution.

## Open Source Software

In the early days of computing most software was highly restricted by commercial
licenses. Most computing experts were hired by private investors and restricted
by NDAs intended to protect the investors intellectual property. Unsurprisingly
this state of affairs created a scenario where people who could have been
collaborting were instead isolated into intellectual silos, often spending years
of their lives creating tools that had--unbeknownst to them--already been
invented.

However with the launch of the Free Software Foundation and [GNU project][gnu]
in 1984, a new model of software development was born: open source software
(OSS), also called _libre_ software. The idea was that software uninihibited by
restrictive licensing could be developed faster and more reliably by people all
across the world. It would also encourage widespread education about software
development. In short, OSS was software for the public good rather than private
interest.

Today OSS is considered the go-to model even for corporate software development.
Examples include:

-   The [Linux Kernel][linux], an operating system kernel
-   [Chromium][chromium], the base of many different web browsers
-   Mozilla [Firefox][firefox], a popular privacy-focused web browser
-   [Libre Office Suite][libreoffice], a collection of office tools including a
    word processor, slide-show builder, spreadsheet editor, and more
-   [VLC Player][vlcplayer], a video player

There are far too many projects to count, but chances are that for any computing
task you might reasonly want to do, there is probably an open source project to
help you do it.

As an educator, I can help you find the right OSS to fit your needs, teach you
to install it, and help you learn how to use the documentation to answer any
questions that may encounter in the future.

## Tutoring

One of the grand failures of the American education system is that it often
scares learners away from pursuing their passion. When I tell people that I am a
mathematician and programmer, a common response is, "Wow, you must be really
smart." The actual case is that our education system has taught so many people
to feel like they aren't. Anyone can learn math, science, and art. All it takes
is practice and dedication, two skills that institutionalized education doesn't
ever really teach.

As an educator, it is my goal to help you find your motiviation in the midst of
a storm that is trying to beat it out of you. I will work with you to identify
your habits and learning styles and figure out how to use those as tools to
reach your goals. This process involves a lot a of self-reflection and looks
more like coaching than traditional tutoring models.

While I am comfortable assisting with any topic that interests you, these are
the topics that I am particularly passionate about:

-   Mathematics
-   Computer Science
-   Physics

If you are looking for education outside of traditional academic pursuits,
please consider my [consulting services](/consulting.html).
