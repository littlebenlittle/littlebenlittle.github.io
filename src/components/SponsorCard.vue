       This card should include a large icon like
       
       https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-holding-heart

       Vuetify has support for font-awesome; see
       https://vuetifyjs.com/en/customization/icons/#install-font-awesome-4-icons)

       but with a project this size, we should probably just add
       the SVG icons to the repo in the assets directory

    <v-card-title>
      Sponsor Me!

      Open source development rarely provides any sort of tangible
      compensation. You can help me keep the code running by donating ðŸ™‡

    <CurrencyExpansionPanelGroup/>

  </v-card>
</template>

<script>
  
  import CurrencyExpansionPanelGroup from "./Currency/ExpansionPanel/Group"

  export default {
    name: 'SponsorCard',
    components: {
        CurrencyExpansionPanelGroup,
    },
    data: () => { return {
